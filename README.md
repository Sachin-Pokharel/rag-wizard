# Starter Template Project

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application structured with modular components, including API endpoints, configuration management, and utility scripts. It is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Project Structure
- `docker/`: Contains Docker-related files including `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerization.
- `src/`: Main source code directory.
  - `main.py`: Application entry point.
  - `schemas.py`: Data schemas used in the application.
  - `api/`: API implementation and endpoints.
  - `config/`: Configuration files.
- `scripts/`: Utility and automation scripts.
- `tests/`: Test cases for the application.
- `utils/`: Utility modules to support the application.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerization)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd starter-template
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate 
   ```

## Running the Application

### Using Docker
Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The application will be accessible at the configured API endpoint.

### Without Docker
Run the application directly:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Testing
Run tests using your preferred test runner, for example:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
